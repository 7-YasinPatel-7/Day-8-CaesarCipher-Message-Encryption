# Day-8-CaesarCipher-Message-Encryption
Created a simple but challenging Encryption functionality in python.
ðŸ‘‹Hello. Want to encrypt a message for a friend to talk secrectly in class or in a group? Create your own by this simple python magicðŸª„.
â€¢On day 8, by creating this Caesar Cipher project I leanrt:
-Defining a function with input/s
-What is Parameters and Arguments.
-Calling a function. Kind of a Lingo in programming/coding world.

#In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code, or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
